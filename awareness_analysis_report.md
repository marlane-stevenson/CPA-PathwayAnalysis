# Awareness Analysis Report

## Does early awareness of the alternative pathway correlate with a decreased desire to pursue a graduate degree?

### Methodology

We analyzed the survey responses focusing on two questions:
- **Awareness**: "Were you aware of the alternative pathway to CPA licensure before taking the survey?" (Column Q53 in the dataset, referred to as Q31 in the task description).
- **Impact**: "How has the availability of (or knowledge about) the alternative pathway to CPA licensure impacted your desire to pursue a graduate degree?" (Column Q52).

The responses to the impact question (Q52) were mapped to a numerical scale:
- Significantly decreased desire = 1
- Decreased desire = 2
- No change in desire = 3
- Increased desire = 4
- Significantly increased desire = 5

### Results

| Group (Awareness) | Average Impact Score | Sample Size |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Yes (Aware) | 2.54 | 89 |
| No (Unaware) | 3.34 | 58 |

### Summary

Those who were **aware** of the alternative pathway had a **lower** average desire score (2.54) compared to those who were unaware (3.34). This suggests a potential correlation between early awareness and a decreased desire to pursue a graduate degree.
